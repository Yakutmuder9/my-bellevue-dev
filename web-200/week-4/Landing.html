                    <p>Hello, I am Amru Jemal, and I will be completing my bachelor’s degree in finance from Western Michigan University in August. I have worked on a wide variety of projects that have allowed me to put what I’ve learned in the classroom into use in a practical sense. Last year, I was part of a new course where the students managed $500,000 for the Western Annual Fund and it was really exciting to see the portfolio grow.  I pride myself on being detail-oriented, analytical, and driven.  I understand that you are searching for a new investment advisor and I believe these qualities would benefit a company’s goal to increase  client base while continuing to provide sound investment advice</p>

                    <p>
                        The thing I like least about my job right now is the limited opportunities to advance and be promoted in the company. It’s a great organization and I’ve learned a lot here, but it’s such a small company that it’s difficult to find ways to move up unless somebody retires or leaves. My group is only four people
